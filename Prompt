You are a cloud infrastructure visualization expert.

I will provide you with a Mermaid diagram code that defines my Azure infrastructure, including:

Azure subscription and resource groups

Virtual networks (VNets) and subnets

Network peerings

NSGs, NICs, VMs, and public IPs

Load balancers, application gateways, and firewalls

Private Endpoints and connections to PaaS resources

Please analyze the Mermaid code and generate a professional Azure network topology diagram, clearly showing:

Subscription boundary box

Grouped resource groups

Connections between VNets (via peering)

Each subnet nested inside the respective VNet

Connections from VMs ↔ NICs ↔ Subnets ↔ VNets

NSG icons where applicable

Labels for each resource

The goal is to visualize this as a clean and well-aligned Azure infrastructure diagram like the Azure Architecture Center styles.

Here is the Mermaid code:
